During this time the field of Bioinformatics came to my attention due to the new approaches it presented. Thus, I decided to join the master\u2019s in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in order to connect the acquired knowledge in Biology with a long passion for computer science. During the master\u2019s course, I soon realized that overcoming challenges and constantly learning is what I believe to be the qualities required in order to become a professional of excellence in this field.
