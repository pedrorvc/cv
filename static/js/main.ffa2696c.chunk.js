During this time the field of Bioinformatics came to my attention due to the potential it presented. Thus, I decided to obtain a master\u2019s degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in order to connect the acquired knowledge in Biology with a long passion for computer science. During the master\u2019s course, I soon realized that overcoming challenges, constant learning and adaptability is what I believe to be the qualities required in order to become a professional of excellence in this field. My latest experience in bioinformatics applied to clinical microbiology has allowed me to further develop my frontend developer skills by designing a service that displays and allows the sharing of cg/wgMLST data.",icon:"usertie"},{type:"common-list",title:"Education",icon:"graduation",items:[{title:"Biology (BS)",authority:"Faculdade de Ci\xeancias da Universidade de Lisboa",authorityWebSite:"https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en",rightSide:"2013 - 2016"},{title:"Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (MSc)",authority:"Faculdade de Ci\xeancias da Universidade de Lisboa",authorityWebSite:"https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en",rightSide:"2016 - 2019"}]},{type:"experiences-list",title:"Experiences",icon:"archive",items:[{title:"Fellowship",company:"Molecular Microbiology and Infection group coordinated by Dr M\xe1rio Ramirez, at Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo\xe3o Lobo Antunes",description:"Maintenance and extension of chewBBACA, a complete suite for gene-by-gene schema creation and strain identification.
